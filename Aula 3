Aula realizada dia 11/03/2025

Realizado algumas tarefas com o uso de IA, usando o Groq utilizando chaves de API, fizemos a inplementação de um programa que faz a trasncrição de vídeos para texto escrito.

from groq import Groq

client = Groq()

chat_completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    #
    # Required parameters
    #
    messages=[
        # Set an optional system message. This sets the behavior of the
        # assistant and can be used to provide specific instructions for
        # how it should behave throughout the conversation.
        {
            "role": "system",
            "content": "you are a helpful assistent."
        },
        # Set a user message for the assistant to respond to.
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Telas oled são as unicas que dão burning?",
        }
    ],

    # The language model which will generate the completion.
    model="distil-whisper-large-v3-en",

    #
    # Optional parameterspy 
    #

    # Controls randomness: lowering results in less random completions.
    # As the temperature approaches zero, the model will become deterministic
    # and repetitive.
    temperature=0.7,

    # The maximum number of tokens to generate. Requests can use up to
    # 32,768 tokens shared between prompt and completion.
    max_completion_tokens=1200,

    # Controls diversity via nucleus sampling: 0.5 means half of all
    # likelihood-weighted options are considered.
    top_p=0.9,

    # A stop sequence is a predefined or user-specified text string that
    # signals an AI to stop generating content, ensuring its responses
    # remain focused and concise. Examples include punctuation marks and
    # markers like "[end]".
    stop=None,

    # If set, partial message deltas will be sent.
    stream=False,
)

# Print the completion returned by the LLM.
print(chat_completion.choices[0].message.content)
